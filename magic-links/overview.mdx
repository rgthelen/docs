## The Power of Rownd Smart Links

- **Authenticate users instantly** across devices and platforms
- **Deep link directly to specific content** within your app or website
- **Track engagement and conversion metrics** through robust analytics
- **Personalize the user experience** based on device, location, or user attributes
- **Streamline user journeys** by removing authentication friction
- **Boost conversion rates** for marketing campaigns and user activation flows

For marketing teams, this means higher conversion rates and better ROI on campaigns. For product teams, it means smoother onboarding and better user retention. For engineering teams, it means less time spent building and maintaining complex linking infrastructure.

In many cases, you can replace Branch or Firebase Dynamic Links with Rownd smart links, as they provide similar functionality at no additional cost with the added benefit of integrated authentication.

### What makes Rownd smart links unique?

- **Integrated authentication**: Unlike standard Smart links, Rownd's Smart Links also manage user sign-in and verification, providing a streamlined login experience across devices and platforms.
- **Security first**: Each link is dynamically generated to verify user identity and restrict unauthorized access.
- **Cross-platform**: Rownd smart links are optimized for use across web, iOS, and Android, ensuring a consistent experience.
- **Unauthenticated / bulk links**: Create reusable links for bulk distribution with a customized call-to-action. Deep link into your app or website or trigger app downloads from the correct app store. This allows users to directly access the download link without requiring authentication.


## Creating and using smart links

Rownd offers two powerful ways to create Smart Links, each designed for different use cases and workflow preferences:

### Platform-Based Creation

You can now create and manage Smart Links directly through the Rownd dashboard without writing any code. Our user-friendly interface allows you to:

- Create reusable Smart Links for marketing campaigns, user onboarding, or app downloads
- Customize link behavior with redirects based on device type
- Add analytics tags to track link performance
- Control how your links appear when shared on social media
- Manage all your links from a central dashboard



The platform approach is perfect for marketing teams, content managers, and anyone who needs to create and manage links without developer involvement. Within minutes, you can create a Smart Link that delivers a tailored experience to your users.

For detailed instructions on creating Smart Links through the platform, see our [Platform Guide](/magic-links/platform).

### API-Based Creation

For developers and automated workflows, Rownd offers a powerful API for programmatically creating Smart Links. This approach enables:

- **Dynamic link generation** based on user actions or events
- **Seamless integration** with existing marketing automation platforms
- **Bulk creation** of personalized links for email campaigns
- **Custom authentication flows** tailored to your specific business needs
- **Web hooks and callbacks** for advanced tracking and user journey orchestration

During email or SMS sign-in, Rownd automatically generates smart links on your behalf and sends them to the user. However, you can also programmatically create smart links using the Rownd API. This allows you to customize the link's behavior, such as redirecting users to specific app screens or triggering custom actions.

To create a smart link, see our [API documentation](/api-reference/authentication/create-smart-link).

#### Example Request

Here's a basic example of how to create a Smart Link using Rownd's API:

```bash
POST https://api.rownd.io/hub/auth/smart
Content-Type: application/json
X-Rownd-App-Key: YOUR_APP_KEY
X-Rownd-App-Secret: YOUR_APP_SECRET

{
  "data": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "redirect_url": "https://yourapp.com/welcome"
}
```

This request will create a Smart Link that authenticates the user when accessed and redirects them to the specified URL.

### Example Response

```json
{
  "link": "https://rownd.link/YOUR_UNIQUE_MAGIC_LINK"
}
```

You can then send this link to the user.

### Using smart links

If you're only using smart links on a web platform, then no additional setup is required. However, if you're using Rownd on a mobile platform like iOS or Android, you'll need to add some configuration to your app and the Rownd dashboard to get everything working properly.

#### iOS setup

Apple requires several changes to your app's configuration to handle smart links. They also require an Apple App Site Association (AASA) file to be properly configured; however, Rownd builds and hosts this file for you.

To complete the required setup, follow the [iOS configuration steps](/configuration/mobile/ios).

After setup, test your links on a physical device to confirm they redirect correctly into the app.

#### Android setup

Android apps require an intent filter in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to handle smart links. Android also requires a Digital Asset Links JSON file to be properly configured; however, Rownd builds and hosts this file for you.

To complete the required setup, follow the [Android configuration steps](/configuration/mobile/android).

After setup, test your links on a physical device to confirm they redirect correctly into the app.


### App download links

After you've configured and tested your mobile apps to handle smart links, you can also direct your mobile users to a special smart link endpoint that will automatically launch your app if it's installed or otherwise direct the user to your app listing on the appropriate app store for their device.

To use this link, simply append `/download` to your Rownd subdomain (configured in Mobile settings). For example, if your subdomain is `myapp`, then the download link would be `https://myapp.rownd.link/download`.

If the user is not on iOS or Android when they activate this link, it'll simply redirect them to your Rownd app's default URL
