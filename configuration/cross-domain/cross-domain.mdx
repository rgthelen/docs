# Cross-Domain Authentication with Rownd

## Overview

Rownd's cross-domain authentication provides a seamless user experience across multiple domains and subdomains without third-party cookies. This modern approach maintains secure user sessions across your entire digital ecosystem.

## How It Works

Rownd uses a novel authentication method that:
- Operates independently of third-party cookies
- Maintains sessions across different domains
- Synchronizes user state automatically
- Preserves security while improving user experience

## Benefits

- **Seamless User Experience**: Users stay signed in across all your properties
- **Cookie-Independent**: Future-proof against browser privacy changes
- **Flexible Implementation**: Works across web apps, mobile apps, and websites
- **Improved Conversion**: Reduces friction in user journeys
- **Enhanced Security**: Maintains secure sessions without compromising user privacy

## Common Use Cases

### Landing Page to Application
1. Add Rownd to your marketing site
2. Enable passive authentication (e.g., Google One Tap)
3. Users automatically sign in when accessing your main application
4. Increases conversion by removing authentication barriers

### Documentation Portal Integration
1. Implement Rownd across your documentation site
2. Provide personalized help based on user context
3. Track documentation usage patterns
4. Deliver customized content based on user preferences

### Multi-App Ecosystem
1. Deploy Rownd across multiple applications
2. Maintain consistent authentication state
3. Works seamlessly with [sub-brands feature](https://docs.rownd.io/configuration/customizations/sub-brands)
4. Create branded experiences for different user segments

## Technical Configuration

### Root Origin Setup

Set `rootOrigin` to:
```
https://<subdomain>.rownd.link/root/<appKey>
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Next.js Integration
```jsx
return (
  <html lang="en">
    <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
      <RowndProvider appKey={rowndAppKey} rootOrigin={rowndRootUrl}>
        <AuthButtonHandler />
        {children}
      </RowndProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

#### JavaScript Snippet
For websites using the standard snippet:
```javascript
window._rphConfig = {
  rootOrigin: 'https://<subdomain>.rownd.link/root/<appKey>'
};
```

Alternative method using SDK:
```javascript
rownd.configure({
  rootOrigin: 'https://<subdomain>.rownd.link/root/<appKey>'
});
```

## Getting Started

1. **Find Your Subdomain**
   - Access Mobile Settings in Authentication methods
   - Note your subdomain from the configuration

2. **Locate Your App Key**
   - Navigate to the App-key section in Platform (app.rownd.io)
   - Copy your unique app key

3. **Implementation Steps**
   - Choose your integration method (SDK or snippet)
   - Configure the root origin
   - Test cross-domain functionality
   - Monitor authentication flows

## Best Practices

1. **Domain Configuration**
   - Maintain consistent configuration across all properties
   - Verify SSL certificates for all domains
   - Test authentication flow in development environment

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Keep app keys secure
   - Use environment variables for sensitive values
   - Regularly monitor authentication patterns

3. **User Experience**
   - Implement passive authentication where appropriate
   - Provide clear feedback during authentication process
   - Test user flows across different domains

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Authentication State Not Syncing**
   - Verify root origin configuration
   - Check SSL certificates
   - Confirm app key is correct

2. **Integration Issues**
   - Review SDK implementation
   - Verify all required dependencies
   - Check console for errors
