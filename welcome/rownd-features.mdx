### Instant Users: Every Visitor is a User

Rownd revolutionizes user management with our "instant users" approach. Unlike traditional systems that only track authenticated users, Rownd assigns a unique identifier to every visitor from their first interaction.

#### How It Works

- **Immediate Recognition**: Every visitor gets a Rownd ID instantly
- **Progressive Enhancement**: The anonymous ID seamlessly transitions to a full user profile upon authentication
- **No Lost Data**: All user activity and data is preserved throughout the journey
- **Cookie-Free Tracking**: Replace messy cookies with secure, privacy-focused user identification

<Note>
With Rownd's instant users, you can start building relationships with visitors before they formally sign up. This means better analytics, more accurate user journeys, and no lost data when anonymous users convert to authenticated users.
</Note>

#### Benefits for Your Business

- **Better Analytics**: Track complete user journeys from first visit
- **Improved Conversion**: Remove friction by gradually collecting user data
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Modern, cookie-free approach to user identification
